# OBS Newsroom

A set of tools for creating professional looking broadcast graphics in [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/)

## Clock

This tool automatically updates multiple text sources from the system clock.  Each text source can be formatted using Lua [date format strings](https://www.lua.org/pil/22.1.html).

## DSK Tool

This tool identifies every scene containing "DSK" in the name as a potential down-stream key candidate.  When the DSK is toggled, it is automatically added or removed from all non-DSK scenes and smoothly transitioned.

Hotkeys may be set to toggle each DSK.
